Overview of MongoDB Connection:
This section will guide you through setting up a MongoDB connection in your Node.js application using Mongoose, 
a popular ODM (Object Data Modeling) library. Mongoose makes it easy to manage data in MongoDB by providing 
a clear and structured way to define data models, connect to the database, and handle interactions.

You will learn about:
1. What Mongoose is and why it is commonly used for managing MongoDB connections in Node.js applications.
2. How to set up a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose, including best practices for handling connection errors.
3. Understanding the structure of the connection code, including starting the server after establishing the 
   connection and error handling.

File Sequence:
1. introduction.txt - Learn what Mongoose is and why itâ€™s beneficial for connecting Node.js applications 
   to MongoDB.
2. mongodbConnection.txt - Explore the step-by-step implementation of connecting to MongoDB using Mongoose, 
   with explanations of each part of the code.

Start with the first file to understand Mongoose and its purpose, then move on to the implementation guide to 
set up your MongoDB connection in your Node.js application.
