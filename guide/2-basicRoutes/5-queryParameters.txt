Working with Query Parameters:
Query parameters are like special instructions that a customer adds when ordering, 
like "extra cheese" or "no onions". These instructions are passed to the kitchen 
so that the dish (response) can be prepared exactly as requested.

Purpose of Query Parameters:
Query parameters allow you to send small pieces of data through the URL to customize 
what you are asking for, like customizing an order at a restaurant.

Code Example:
-----------------------------------
router.get("/greet", (req, res) => {
  const { name } = req.query; 
  // This is like checking the order slip for special instructions.

  if (!name) {
    return res.status(400).send("No name provided"); 
    // This is like saying, "Sorry, I need a name to greet you!"
  }

  res.send(`Hello, ${name}!`); 
  // The dish (response) is prepared according to the customer's request.
});
-----------------------------------

This example shows how to use query parameters to personalize the response based 
on what the client asks for.
