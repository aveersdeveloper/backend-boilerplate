What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a waiter in a restaurant. 
The waiter takes your order (request), tells the kitchen what you want, and 
brings the food (response) back to your table. Just like this, an API allows 
different parts of software to communicate and exchange information.

What is Express.js?
Imagine Express.js as the manager of a restaurant who organizes everything 
smoothly. It helps to set up the restaurant (your server), manage waiters 
(your routes), handle orders (requests), and make sure that the right food 
(responses) gets to the right table (client). Express.js is like the backbone 
that makes sure everything runs smoothly without you having to worry about the 
details.

Core Components:
- Request (req): Think of this as the customer's order slip with all the 
  details of what they want.
- Response (res): This is like the dish prepared in the kitchen, ready to be 
  served to the customer.
- NextFunction (next): Imagine a situation where the waiter hands off the order 
  to the kitchen; sometimes the waiter needs help from another waiter to 
  complete the task. The "next" function is used to pass control to the next 
  step in the process, like calling another waiter for help.
