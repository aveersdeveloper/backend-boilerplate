Understanding Middleware:
Middleware functions are like the various checks in a restaurant before the dish 
reaches the customer. Think of them as quality checks, ensuring that everything 
is correct before the meal is served. For example, a waiter might double-check 
the order, another might taste the soup, and another might add final garnishes 
before itâ€™s sent to the customer.

Common Request Fields:
- req.method: This is like the type of order being made: Dine-in (GET) or Takeaway (POST).
- req.url: The path or specific section of the menu being asked for, like Drinks or Main Course.
- req.ip: The table number or location of the customer making the request.
- req.headers['user-agent']: Details about the customer, like whether they are a regular or a first-time visitor.

Code Example for Middleware:
-----------------------------------
const requestLog = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} request for '${req.url}'`); 
  // This is the waiter noting down the order details.

  next(); 
  // Passes the control to the next stage, like sending the order to the kitchen.
};
-----------------------------------

Inline vs. External Middleware:
Inline middleware is like adding spices directly at the table, while external 
middleware is prepared separately in the kitchen and added to the dish.
