Creating a Basic GET Route:
A GET route is like a customer asking for the menu: "Show me what you have!". 
The server responds by handing over the information, just like showing a menu 
to a customer in a restaurant.

Purpose of a GET Route:
GET routes are used when you want to fetch or retrieve data from the server 
without making any changes. Think of it as simply asking to see what's available.

Code Example:
-----------------------------------
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!"); 
  // This is like handing the customer a menu that says, "Here's what we have!"
});
-----------------------------------

In this simple example, the customer (client) asks to see the menu, and we respond 
with a basic greeting.
