Overview of Response Code Routes:
This section will guide you through understanding and implementing HTTP response codes 
in your API routes using Express.js. Response codes are essential for communicating the 
status of a request between the server and the client, similar to how a waiter informs you 
about the status of your order in a restaurant.

You will learn about:
1. What response codes are and why they are important in API communication.
2. Different types of response codes that can be used in GET requests, including common 
   ones like 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 401 (Unauthorized).
3. How to implement response codes in your routes to provide clear feedback about the 
   outcome of a request.
4. A list of various response codes with brief explanations to familiarize you with more 
   options available.

File Sequence:
1. introduction.txt - Learn what response codes are through analogies and understand 
   their purpose in APIs.
2. responseCodeImplementation.txt - Understand the implementation of a specific response 
   code in a GET request with a clear, step-by-step example.
3. responseCodeList.txt - Explore a comprehensive list of response codes with brief, 
   one-line explanations for each.

Start with the first file to understand the basic concepts of response codes. Then, move 
on to the implementation and explore the list of response codes to expand your knowledge 
on how they can be used in various scenarios.
