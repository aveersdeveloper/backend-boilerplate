Implementing a 200 OK Response:
A 200 OK response code is like the waiter bringing your food to the table and confirming 
that everything went perfectly as expected. It indicates that the request was successful 
and that the server was able to fulfill the clientâ€™s request.

Purpose of a 200 OK Response:
The 200 OK status code is used to indicate that the request was successfully received, 
understood, and processed by the server. It is the most common status code for successful 
GET requests.

Code Example:
-----------------------------------
router.get("/success", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send("Request was successful!"); 
  // This is like the waiter serving your food, confirming that the order was processed correctly.
});
-----------------------------------

In this example, the client makes a request, and the server responds with a 200 OK status 
code, indicating that the request was handled successfully without any issues.
