Introduction to Response Codes:
Response codes are like the feedback you get from a restaurant when you place an order. 
Just like the kitchen lets the waiter know if your dish is ready, unavailable, or if 
there's a problem, response codes tell clients the outcome of their requests.

Why Are Response Codes Important?
Imagine ordering a dish, but instead of the waiter telling you if it's being prepared, 
unavailable, or if there’s a delay, you’re left guessing. Response codes help avoid this 
confusion by clearly communicating the status of every request.

Common Response Codes Explained:
- 200 OK: This is like the waiter bringing your food to the table with a smile, indicating 
  everything went well and your order was successful.
  
- 404 Not Found: Imagine asking for a dish that’s not on the menu. The waiter responds with 
  "Sorry, we don't have that." A 404 tells you the server couldn't find what you asked for.

- 401 Unauthorized: This is like trying to enter a VIP area without the right credentials. 
  The bouncer stops you and says, "You can't enter without permission." A 401 means you need 
  proper authorization to access the resource.

Using Response Codes in APIs:
Response codes ensure that communication between the server (kitchen) and the client 
(customer) is clear and concise. They help developers understand what's happening with 
their requests and guide users on what to do next.
