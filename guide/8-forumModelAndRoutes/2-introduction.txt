Introduction to the Forum Application:
The forum application is designed to facilitate user interaction through questions and answers. Users can create 
questions, view others’ questions, and provide answers. This application mimics a simple discussion board or 
community forum, making it a great example for learning how to implement CRUD operations with nested documents 
using Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose.

Why Use Mongoose?
Mongoose helps structure and manage data in MongoDB, providing schemas and models that ensure data consistency. 
It simplifies database interactions, allowing developers to define clear data structures and leverage built-in 
validation and error handling.

The Role of Interfaces:
In the basic CRUD model, we didn’t use interfaces because the data structure was straightforward and could be managed 
with basic schemas. However, in the forum application, interfaces are used to provide type definitions, enhancing 
code clarity and type safety. Interfaces help define the structure of documents, especially when dealing with nested 
objects like answers within questions.

In the next sections, you will learn how to create the models for questions and answers, and how interfaces help 
organize and manage complex data structures in Mongoose.
