Overview of the Backend Project:
Welcome to the backend development! In this project, you will dive deep into the world of backend 
development, focusing on key concepts and technologies that are widely used in the industry today. This 
course is designed to provide you with hands-on experience, guiding you through each step of the process 
to build a robust backend for a web application.

What You Will Learn:
1. **Routes and REST APIs**: You will learn what routes are, how they work, and how to create them using 
   Express.js. You'll gain a deep understanding of REST APIs, which are the backbone of modern web applications.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Explore how to protect your server from excessive requests by implementing rate limiters 
   using `express-rate-limit`.
3. **MongoDB and Mongoose**: You will learn how to set up a MongoDB database and use Mongoose to create schemas 
   and models, bringing structure to your data and making it easy to interact with your database.
4. **Basic CRUD Operations**: You will implement basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, 
   providing the core functionality of any backend application.
5. **Forum Application**: The course culminates in the development of a simple forum application, where you'll 
   put together everything you've learnedâ€”creating routes, managing data, and handling nested operations within 
   a real-world scenario.

By the end of this course, you will have built a solid understanding of backend development using Node.js, 
Express.js, and MongoDB. You'll gain practical skills that are crucial for any aspiring web developer and 
be ready to tackle more advanced backend projects in the future.
