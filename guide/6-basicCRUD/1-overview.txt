Overview of Simple CRUD Operations:
This section will guide you through setting up basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in your 
Node.js application using Mongoose and Express.js. You will learn how to create models using Mongoose and 
implement CRUD routes using HTTP methods like POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.

You will learn about:
1. What Mongoose is and why it is commonly used in Node.js applications to interact with MongoDB.
2. How to create a simple Mongoose model with basic fields to structure your data.
3. Implementing CRUD routes using Express.js to create, read, update, and delete data in your application.

File Sequence:
1. introduction.txt - Learn what Mongoose is through analogies and understand its role in connecting your application 
   to MongoDB.
2. modelCreation.txt - Learn how to create a Mongoose model with basic fields and understand the role of models 
   in managing data.
3. crudRoutes.txt - Explore how to set up routes for CRUD operations using Mongoose models in Express.js.

Start with the first file to understand what Mongoose is and why it's used, then move on to creating models and 
setting up CRUD routes.
