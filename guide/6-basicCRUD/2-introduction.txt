Introduction to Mongoose:
Mongoose is like a translator between your application and MongoDB, making it easy to structure, manage, and 
interact with your data. Think of Mongoose as a librarian who not only organizes books but also ensures every 
book follows a specific format, helping both the library (MongoDB) and visitors (your application) find what 
they need efficiently.

Why Use Mongoose?
While MongoDB is flexible and allows you to store data in various formats, it doesn’t enforce any structure. 
Mongoose adds a structured layer on top of MongoDB, much like a set of rules that help keep your library organized. 
It lets you define schemas (blueprints) for your data, ensuring consistency and making your data easier to manage.

Mongoose also provides built-in methods to query, update, and manipulate data without writing complex MongoDB 
commands. It’s like having a librarian who knows exactly where every book is, how to categorize them, and how to 
retrieve them quickly.

Key Benefits of Using Mongoose:
- **Schemas and Models**: Mongoose allows you to define data structures, making sure your data is consistent 
  and organized.
- **Simplified Data Interaction**: Mongoose simplifies the way you interact with your database, providing easy-to-use 
  methods for querying, updating, and deleting data.
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Mongoose provides built-in validation to ensure that your data meets the 
  required format before it's saved.

In the next sections, you will learn how to create a Mongoose model and set up CRUD routes to manage data in your 
application.
