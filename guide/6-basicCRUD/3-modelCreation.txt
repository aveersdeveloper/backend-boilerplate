Creating a Simple Mongoose Model:
In Mongoose, models are like blueprints that define the structure of data in your application. Think of a model 
as a registration form where you specify what information needs to be filled out, such as a studentâ€™s name or course.

Purpose of a Model:
Models ensure that the data stored in your MongoDB follows a consistent format, making it easier to manage and 
query. This is similar to having a standardized form for all students, ensuring that everyone provides the same 
types of information.

Code Example:
-----------------------------------
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

// Defining a simple model with fields: name and course
const studentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true, // This field must be filled out, like making the name mandatory on a form.
  },
  course: {
    type: String,
    required: true, // The course field is also required, ensuring consistency in the stored data.
  }
});

const Student = mongoose.model('Student', studentSchema);
export default Student;
-----------------------------------

This code defines a simple student model with `name` and `course` fields, setting the foundation for implementing 
CRUD operations. The model ensures that every student record will include these fields, maintaining a consistent 
structure for your data.
