Overview of MongoDB Introduction:
This section will introduce you to MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database used in modern web applications. 
You will learn about what MongoDB is, the difference between NoSQL and SQL, and the role of data formats 
like JSON and BSON in storing and retrieving data. This foundational knowledge will set the stage for 
connecting your Node.js applications to a MongoDB database.

You will learn about:
1. What MongoDB is and why itâ€™s widely used in web development.
2. The concept of NoSQL databases and how they compare to traditional SQL databases.
3. Understanding JSON, a common data format used in APIs and web applications.
4. Introduction to BSON, the binary-encoded format used by MongoDB for efficient data storage.

File Sequence:
1. introduction.txt - Learn what MongoDB is through analogies and understand its role in database management.
2. noSQL_vs_SQL.txt - Explore the concept of NoSQL databases and compare them with traditional SQL databases.
3. json.txt - Understand JSON, its structure, and why it's commonly used in data exchange.
4. bson.txt - Learn about BSON, the data format used by MongoDB, and how it differs from JSON.

Start with the first file to understand the basic concepts of MongoDB, then move through each file to 
gain a comprehensive understanding of the technologies and data formats involved.
