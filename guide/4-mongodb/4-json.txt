Understanding JSON:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is like a universal language for data, similar to how people from different 
countries might all understand basic symbols or pictures. It’s used to structure data in a way that is easy to 
read and write by both humans and machines.

JSON Example:
Imagine a simple menu:
{
  "dish": "Pizza",
  "ingredients": ["cheese", "tomato", "basil"],
  "price": 12.99
}

This structure is clear and flexible, showing what the item is, what it includes, and its cost, making it easy 
to understand at a glance.

JSON is used everywhere in web development because it’s straightforward and can easily be passed between servers 
and web applications, allowing for smooth communication and data exchange.
