NoSQL vs. SQL:
SQL databases are like traditional filing cabinets where every document follows a specific format and order. 
If you want to store a new type of document, you need to redesign the entire cabinet to fit it in.

NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, are more like a versatile storage room where you can stack boxes of different 
sizes and shapes. You don't need to reorganize the entire space to add something new, making it easy to adapt 
to changing requirements.

Comparison:
- SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are great for structured data, with rows and columns like a 
  spreadsheet. They are perfect for data that doesnâ€™t change often, like accounting records.
- NoSQL databases (like MongoDB) handle unstructured or semi-structured data, like customer feedback or 
  social media posts, without the need for a rigid schema. This makes them ideal for rapidly changing 
  environments.
