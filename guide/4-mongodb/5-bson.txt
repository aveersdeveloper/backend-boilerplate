Understanding BSON:
BSON (Binary JSON) is like JSONâ€™s more efficient cousin, designed to make data storage and retrieval faster and 
more compact. While JSON is great for readability, BSON is optimized for performance, especially when dealing 
with large datasets.

BSON in Action:
Imagine JSON as a recipe card you can read easily, but BSON as a neatly packed box that contains all the ingredients 
ready to go. You might not be able to see each ingredient at a glance, but everything is stored in the most efficient 
way to make cooking (or in this case, data retrieval) quicker.

MongoDB uses BSON to store data because it makes queries faster and keeps data organized in a way that machines 
can process rapidly, making it perfect for high-performance applications.
