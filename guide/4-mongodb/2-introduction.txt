Introduction to MongoDB:
MongoDB is like a giant library with shelves that don't follow traditional rules. Instead of storing books in 
strictly ordered rows like a traditional library, MongoDB organizes its shelves in a way that’s flexible, 
making it easy to add or change information without following a rigid structure.

Why Use MongoDB?
Think of MongoDB as a dynamic bookshelf that adapts to the shape of any book. Whether your book is a novel, 
a magazine, or a picture album, MongoDB’s shelves can handle them all. This flexibility makes MongoDB ideal 
for handling a variety of data types, allowing developers to build applications quickly without worrying 
about strict database rules.

MongoDB is widely used because it’s fast, flexible, and scales easily, just like adding more shelves to a library 
when you have more books. This makes it perfect for modern web applications where data formats and requirements 
can frequently change.
