Introduction to Rate Limiting:
Rate limiting is like a traffic signal at a busy intersection. Just like a traffic signal controls the flow 
of vehicles to ensure everyone moves safely and efficiently, rate limiting manages the flow of requests to 
your server to prevent it from becoming overloaded.

Why Use Rate Limiting?
Imagine a busy road without traffic signals—vehicles would move chaotically, leading to traffic jams and accidents. 
Similarly, if a server receives too many requests at once, it can become overwhelmed, slowing down or even crashing. 
Rate limiting helps manage this by controlling the number of requests a user can make within a specific time frame, 
ensuring smooth and fair usage for all.

Rate limiting is essential for:
- **Preventing Abuse**: It protects your server from being overwhelmed by excessive requests, whether intentional 
  (DDoS attacks) or accidental.
- **Ensuring Fair Usage**: By limiting the number of requests per user, it ensures that all users get fair access 
  to the server’s resources.
- **Enhancing Security**: Rate limiting can help mitigate brute force attacks by limiting repeated attempts 
  within a short time.

Using `express-rate-limit`:
`express-rate-limit` is a popular middleware for implementing rate limiting in Express.js applications. It allows 
you to define rules for request limits, such as how many requests are allowed per IP address and the time window 
for these requests.

In the next section, you will see how to use `express-rate-limit` to set up rate limiting in your server, protecting 
it from excessive traffic and ensuring fair usage for all users.
