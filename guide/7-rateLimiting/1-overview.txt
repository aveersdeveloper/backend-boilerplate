Overview of Rate Limiting:
This section will introduce rate limiting and guide you through implementing it in your Node.js application 
using the `express-rate-limit` middleware. Rate limiting helps protect your server from excessive requests 
by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a certain time frame.

You will learn about:
1. What rate limiting is and why itâ€™s important in web applications.
2. An introduction to `express-rate-limit`, a popular middleware for implementing rate limiting in Express.js.
3. How to apply rate limiting to your entire server to enhance security and ensure fair usage.

File Sequence:
1. introduction.txt - Learn what rate limiting is through analogies and understand its purpose in protecting 
   your application.
2. rateLimiterImplementation.txt - Explore the implementation of rate limiting using the `express-rate-limit` 
   middleware with a detailed explanation of the code.

Start with the introduction to understand the concept of rate limiting, then move on to the implementation guide 
to set up rate limiting in your application.
