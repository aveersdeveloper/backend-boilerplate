// Ensure your updated model with `college` and `place` is imported correctly.

const router = Router();

// Exercise:
// 1. Update the CRUD Routes: Modify the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE routes to handle the new fields `college` and `place`.
//    - Ensure the POST route accepts and saves the new fields.
//    - The GET route should display the new fields when retrieving student records.
//    - Update the PUT route to allow modifications to the new fields.
//    - Confirm that the DELETE route still functions correctly with the updated model.
